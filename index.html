      <!-- Intent: define the format clearly -->
      <p>
        Small-sided soccer is any competitive match with fewer than 11 players per team—typically 3v3 to 8v8—played on a smaller field with smaller goals.
        The tighter space speeds up the game and encourages constant involvement from every player.
      </p>

      <!-- Intent: who it's for + why it's friendly for learning -->
      <p>
        It's great for kids who are learning and adults who want to refine skills, because the changing situations force quick thinking and adaptable play.
        Players get far more touches than in full-size games, which accelerates improvement in ball mastery, confidence, and decision-making.
