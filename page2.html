      <p>
        In small-sided soccer, a few core skills make a huge difference. Simple 1v1 moves like an inside–outside cut or a scissors feint can create just enough space to escape pressure.
        A strong first touch that pushes the ball into space sets up the next action, whether that's a quick shot or a pass.
        Wall-passes, or give-and-go combinations, are especially effective because of the limited field size.
        Scanning before receiving the ball also matters—checking where defenders and teammates are saves precious seconds.
      </p>

      <p>
        Compared to full-size soccer, small-sided games give beginners far more touches and decisions per minute.
        Instead of waiting on the wing for the ball, you’re constantly involved, which speeds up learning and makes the game less intimidating.
        A common myth is that you have to be extremely fast to enjoy small-sided soccer, but the reality is that smart positioning and quick passing often matter more than raw speed.

      <ul>
        <li>Keep teams small and rotate often for equal touches.</li>
        <li>Use constraints (two-touch only, must switch play before scoring) to shape decisions.</li>
      </ul>

      <ol>
        <li>Set up: cones, small goals, timer/phone, 6–10 players.</li>
        <li>Game flow: 2 × 7–10 minute halves, 2-minute rest, quick subs every 2–3 minutes.</li>
      </ol>
